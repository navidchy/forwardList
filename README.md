# Forward List

## Overview
A templated singly linked list class called `Forward_list` with several features similar to `std::forward_list`. Key features include maintaining the size of the list, implementing a copy constructor, constructing a list from an initializer list, sorting the list using merge sort, and basic list operations like `push_front`, `pop_front`, and `front`.

## Features
- **Copy Constructor**: Initialize a linked list from another linked list.
- **Initializer List Constructor**: Initialize a linked list from an initializer list, e.g., `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- **push_front**: Add an element to the front of the list.
- **pop_front**: Remove the first element of the list.
- **front**: Access the first element of the list.
- **display**: Print out the list.
- **merge and split**: Helper functions to implement merge sort.
